      <font size="+4"> L</font>inux is a Unix-like, open source and
      community-developed operating system (OS) for computers, servers,
      mainframes, mobile devices and embedded devices. It is supported on almost
      every major computer platform, including x86, ARM and SPARC, making it one
      of the most widely supported operating systems.

      <h3>
        <b>How is the Linux operating system used?</p></b>
      </h3>
      <p id="c">
      Every version of the Linux OS manages hardware resources, launches and
      handles applications, and provides some form of user interface. The
      enormous community for developers and wide range of distributions means
      that a Linux version is available for almost any task, and Linux has
      penetrated many areas of computing.
      </p>
      <p id="d">
      For example, Linux has emerged as a popular OS for web servers such as
      Apache, as well as for network operations, scientific computing tasks that
      require huge compute clusters, running databases, desktop and endpoint
      computing, and running mobile devices with OS versions like Android.
      </p>
      <p id="e">
      The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <b>
          <li>Bootloader ‚Äì</li>
        </b>
        <p id="f">
        The software that manages the boot process of your computer. For most
        users, this will simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually
        goes away to boot into the operating system.
        </p>
        <b>
          <li>Kernel ‚Äì</li>
        </b>
        <p id="g">
        This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called ‚ÄòLinux‚Äô. The
        kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and
        peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.
        </p>
        <b>
          <li>Init system ‚Äì</li>
        </b>
        <p id="h">
        This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with
        controlling daemons. One of the most widely used init systems is
        systemd, which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is
        the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting
        is handed over from the bootloader (i.e., GRUB or GRand Unified
        Bootloader).
        </p>
        <b>
          <li>Daemons ‚Äì</li>
        </b>
        <p id="i">
        These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that
        either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.
        </p>
        <b>
          <li>Graphical server ‚Äì</li>
        </b>
        <p id="j">
        This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is
        commonly referred to as the X server or just X.
        </p>
        <b>
          <li>Desktop environment ‚Äì</li>
        </b>
        <p id="k">
        This is the piece that the users actually interact with. There are many
        desktop environments to choose from (GNOME, Cinnamon, Mate, Pantheon,
        Enlightenment, KDE, Xfce, etc.). Each desktop environment includes
        built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web
        browsers, and games).
        </p>
        <b>
          <li>Applications ‚Äì</li>
        </b>
        <p id="l">
        Desktop environments do not offer the full array of apps. Just like
        Windows and macOS, Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality
        software titles that can be easily found and installed. Most modern
        Linux distributions (more on this below) include App Store-like tools
        that centralize and simplify application installation. For example,
        Ubuntu Linux has the Ubuntu Software Center (a rebrand of GNOME
        Software) which allows you to quickly search among the thousands of apps
        and install them from one centralized location.

      <h4>
        <b> Why use Linux? </b>
      </h4>
      <p id="m">
      This is the one question that most people ask. Why bother learning a
      completely different computing environment, when the operating system that
      ships with most desktops, laptops, and servers works just fine?
      </p>
      <p id="n">
      To answer that question, I would pose another question. Does that
      operating system you‚Äôre currently using really work ‚Äújust fine‚Äù? Or, do
      you find yourself battling obstacles like viruses, malware, slow downs,
      crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees? If you struggle with the
      above, Linux might be the perfect platform for you. Linux has evolved into
      one of the most reliable computer ecosystems on the planet. Combine that
      reliability with zero cost of entry and you have the perfect solution for
      a desktop platform.
      </p>
      <p id="o">
      That‚Äôs right, zero cost of entry‚Ä¶ as in free. You can install Linux on as
      many computers as you like without paying a cent for software or server
      licensing.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p id="p">
      Let‚Äôs take a look at the cost of a Linux server in comparison to Windows
      Server 2016. The price of the Windows Server 2016 Standard edition is
      $882.00 USD (purchased directly from Microsoft). That doesn‚Äôt include
      Client Access License (CALs) and licenses for other software you may need
      to run (such as a database, a web server, mail server, etc.). For example,
      a single user CAL, for Windows Server 2016, costs $38.00. If you need to
      add 10 users, for example, that‚Äôs $388.00 more dollars for server software
      licensing. With the Linux server, it‚Äôs all free and easy to install. In
      fact, installing a full-blown web server (that includes a database
      server), is just a few clicks or commands away (take a look at Easy LAMP
      Server Installation to get an idea how simple it can be).
      </p>
      <p id="q">
      If zero cost isn‚Äôt enough to win you over‚Äìwhat about having an operating
      system that will work, trouble free, for as long as you use it? I‚Äôve used
      Linux for nearly 20 years (as both a desktop and server platform) and have
      not had any issues with ransomware, malware, or viruses. Linux is
      generally far less vulnerable to such attacks. As for server reboots,
      they‚Äôre only necessary if the kernel is updated. It is not out of the
      ordinary for a Linux server to go years without being rebooted. If you
      follow the regular recommended updates, stability and dependability are
      practically assured.
